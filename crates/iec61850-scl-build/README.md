# iec61850-scl-build

Build-script helper that turns an `.icd`, `.cid` or `.scd` file into Rust
code at compile time. The generated file lands in `OUT_DIR/model.rs`, and
the user crate pulls it in with `iec61850_scl::include_compiled_model!()`.
The emit layer turns values into tokens and re-derives no semantics: every
type lookup, functional-constraint parse and trigger-option composition is
the run-time parser's, so a compiled model matches what
[iec61850-scl](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-scl) would build at run
time from the same file.

Part of [iec61850-rust](https://github.com/csp0924/iec61850-rust), an
independent Rust implementation of IEC 61850 (MMS, GOOSE, Sampled Values,
SCL) written from the published standards. See the workspace
[conformance statement](https://github.com/csp0924/iec61850-rust/blob/main/docs/PICS.md)
for exactly which ACSI services are implemented.

## The iec61850-* family

All crates are layers of one workspace, versioned and released together.
Most applications depend on the top of the stack and pull the rest in as
dependencies:

- [iec61850-client](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-client) - IED client:
  directory browsing, read and write, data sets, reporting, control, journals
- [iec61850-server](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-server) - IED server
  runtime: MMS mapping, reporting, control, logging, setting groups
- [iec61850-goose](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-goose) and
  [iec61850-sv](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-sv) - GOOSE and Sampled
  Values on raw Ethernet
- [iec61850-scl](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-scl) and
  [iec61850-scl-build](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-scl-build) - SCL
  parsing and compile-time model generation
- [iec61850-mms](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-mms),
  [iec61850-model](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-model),
  [iec61850-asn1](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-asn1),
  [iec61850-hal](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-hal),
  [iec61850-tls](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-tls),
  [iec61850-sntp](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-sntp) - the supporting
  layers

The [workspace repository](https://github.com/csp0924/iec61850-rust) ties
them together; a Python binding is published on PyPI as
[iec61850](https://pypi.org/project/iec61850/).

## Example

In the user crate's `build.rs`:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    iec61850_scl_build::compile_icd("config/MyIED.icd")
        .out_file("model.rs")
        .compile()
        .unwrap();
}
```

In the user crate's source:

```rust,ignore
iec61850_scl::include_compiled_model!();

fn main() {
    let model = build_MyIED_model();
    // start a server with it
}
```
