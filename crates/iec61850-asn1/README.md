# iec61850-asn1

The shared BER codec core for the MMS, GOOSE and Sampled Values layers. It
holds only what all three layers use with identical semantics: definite-length
encoding and decoding per ISO/IEC 8825-1 (the short form, plus a long form of
at most two length bytes), the recursion-depth guards for nested MMS `Data`
structures, and `Asn1Error`, which each layer converts into its own error type.
PDU-level tag dispatch stays in the layer that owns the PDU.

Guarantees a caller relies on: the indefinite length form `0x80` is rejected
rather than scanned for an end-of-contents marker; decoding depth is capped by
the smaller of the local and the negotiated limit; and `decode_length` returns
a `Result`, so a malformed length field cannot be ignored.

Part of [iec61850-rust](https://github.com/csp0924/iec61850-rust), an
independent Rust implementation of IEC 61850 (MMS, GOOSE, Sampled Values,
SCL) written from the published standards. See the workspace
[conformance statement](https://github.com/csp0924/iec61850-rust/blob/main/docs/PICS.md)
for exactly which ACSI services are implemented.

## The iec61850-* family

All crates are layers of one workspace, versioned and released together.
Most applications depend on the top of the stack and pull the rest in as
dependencies:

- [iec61850-client](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-client) - IED client:
  directory browsing, read and write, data sets, reporting, control, journals
- [iec61850-server](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-server) - IED server
  runtime: MMS mapping, reporting, control, logging, setting groups
- [iec61850-goose](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-goose) and
  [iec61850-sv](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-sv) - GOOSE and Sampled
  Values on raw Ethernet
- [iec61850-scl](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-scl) and
  [iec61850-scl-build](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-scl-build) - SCL
  parsing and compile-time model generation
- [iec61850-mms](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-mms),
  [iec61850-model](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-model),
  [iec61850-asn1](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-asn1),
  [iec61850-hal](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-hal),
  [iec61850-tls](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-tls),
  [iec61850-sntp](https://crates.io/crates/iec61850-sntp) - the supporting
  layers

The [workspace repository](https://github.com/csp0924/iec61850-rust) ties
them together; a Python binding is published on PyPI as
[iec61850](https://pypi.org/project/iec61850/).

## Feature flags

Default: `std`.

- `std` (default) - implies `alloc` and switches the dependencies to their std
  modes. A desktop build needs no other flag.
- `alloc` - the `no_std` path. An embedded target builds with
  `--no-default-features --features alloc`.
